# My private recipe collection
_An attempt to help others cook quality meals for their dietary goals and/or restrictions_

## About this repository
This is just a collection of recipes I use for meal prep.
Why am I doing this? - Just because friends often ask me what I cook for meal prep.
The second reason is that when I switched to meal prep mostly plant-based dishes, I learned that it's very difficult to get a good macronutrient ratio.
I'm a sporty guy and like to eat a lot of proteins. 
I also have certain dietary restrictions, but I'm trying to make the best out of them.

This repository has, by no means, the goal to dictate to anyone how they should eat.
It's just a list of recipes - do whatever you want with it.

## General note on ingredients
I only list the measurements of the main ingredients as seasoning is something that everyone should do to taste.
Further, stuff like oil for sauteeing is something highly dependent on the pan used, so I won't list that either - I usually use olive oil.
